# Churn-data-visualiser

Build D-tale visualizer on bank churn data using binder. 

Steps to access the interactive visualizer:

2. run the first cell, and click on the link that will appear.

Now you are in to visuliazer, try to explore the interface and some interisting features (look at *charts*, *Feature Analysis*, *Correlation* and try *\<code export>* with each feature) and see if you can find anything interesting.
